# PCBS Project: Perceptual Selection based on Alphanumeric Class

The aim of this project was to replicate [J. Duncan (1983) experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03202935) on perceptual selection depending on the alphanumeric class of the stimulus. 


The experiment consists in a succession of trials in which a stimulus made of 6 randomized alphanumeric characters is displayed on the screen for a varying amount of time. The participant is asked to either enter only the letters he can remember (e.g. partial report), by typing one the keyboard, or to enter all of the characters (letters and numbers, whole report) he can remember. The responses entered are recorded. 



3 exposure conditions will be used: displays will last for 60, 90 or 120 msec followed by a mask for 500msec. 
There are 6 blocked experimental conditions at stake here: 2 (partial, whole) x 3 (display duration). There will be 8 trials for each of these 6 blocked conditions.

## Running the experiment

To run the experiment on your computer, you must have Python and the Expyriment module installed. 
Once Python and Expyriment are installed, you can click on [Code](https://github.com/alextvk/pcbs-project-perceptual-selection/blob/main/perceptual-selection-duncan-AT.py) and download the ZIP file attached. Extract it on your computer. 

Then, you can open a Terminal and change the directory to where the file was downloaded. 
Then, type: 
<python perceptual-selection-duncan-AT.py>  


## Analyzing the results
In order to analyze the results of your experiment, you can use the following script: [download the zip file](https://github.com/alextvk/pcbs-project-perceptual-selection/blob/main/result-analysis.py), extract it on your computer. Then, open a Terminal, change the directory to where the file was downloaded and type: 
<python result-analysis.py>

Analyzing the results I got from 3 participants (me included), I can conclude that

## Previous coding experience
I had followed Datacamp during the first semester, focusing on data analysis and vizualisation using exclusively R. Before that, I had followed a class on how to program VBA for Excel. 
Overall, I was new to Python!

## What I learned and what I missed in the PCBS course
Working on this project had definitely help me progress in programming in general, and has taught me the basics on Python. 

However, the online only format of this class was hard to follow for a beginner like me. I wish we had access to Datacamp in parallel in order to practice with immediate feedback between classes for instance. I thank you very much for your patience and availability, even outside of class hours! Being guided by your advice and expertise was the most enriching!
