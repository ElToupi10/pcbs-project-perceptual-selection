# PCBS Project: Perceptual Selection based on Alphanumeric Class

In this project, I will try to replicate J. Duncan (1983) experiment on perceptual selection depending on the alphanumeric class of the stimulus. 

There will be two conditions in this experiment: a partial report task and a whole report task. 
Participants will be presented with two very brief displays of mixed digits and letters. Each display will be made up of 6 random characters.
4 exposure conditions will be used: displays will last for 60, 90 or 120 msec followed by a mask for 500msec, or will last for 120 msec with no mask. 
There are 8 blocked experimental conditions at stake here: 2 (partial, whole) x 4 (display duration). There will be 40 trials for each of these 8 blocked conditions.

In the partial report condition, the task will be to report as many digits as possible while ignoring letters, or vice versa.
In the whole report condition, both digits and letters will need to be reported. 

Reports will be asked to the participants immediately after each display: they will be typed by the participation without considering their order.
