# PCBS Project: Perceptual Selection based on Alphanumeric Class

The aim of this project was to replicate [J. Duncan (1983) experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03202935) on perceptual selection depending on the alphanumeric class of the stimulus. 


The experiment consists in a succession of trials in which a stimulus made of 6 randomized alphanumeric characters is displayed on the screen for a varying amount of time. The participant is asked to either enter only the letters he can remember (e.g. partial report), by typing one the keyboard, or to enter all of the characters (letters and numbers, whole report) he can remember. The responses entered are recorded. 



3 exposure conditions will be used: displays will last for 60, 90 or 120 msec followed by a mask for 500msec. 
There are 6 blocked experimental conditions at stake here: 2 (partial, whole) x 3 (display duration). There will be 8 trials for each of these 6 blocked conditions.

## Running the experiment

To run the experiment on your computer, you must have Python and the Expyriment module installed. 
Once Python and Expyriment are installed, you can click and Code and download the ZIP file attached. 
Extract it on your computer. 
Then, you can open a Terminal and change the directory to where the file was downloaded. 
Then, type: 
`<addr>` python perceptual-selection-duncan-AT.py 



## Analyzing the results
if the project involves analyses, the README.md should point to a documents (html, pdf, not Word!!!) containing the report.
