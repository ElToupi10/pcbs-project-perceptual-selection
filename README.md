# PCBS Project: Perceptual Selection based on Alphanumeric Class

In this project, I will try to partly replicate J. Duncan (1983) experiment on perceptual selection depending on the alphanumeric class of the stimulus. 

There will be two conditions in this experiment: a partial report task and a whole report task. 
Participants will be presented with very brief displays of mixed digits and letters. Each display will be made up of 6 random characters.
3 exposure conditions will be used: displays will last for 60, 90 or 120 msec followed by a mask for 500msec. 
There are 6 blocked experimental conditions at stake here: 2 (partial, whole) x 3 (display duration). There will be 10 trials for each of these 6 blocked conditions.

In the partial report condition, the task will be to report as many letters as possible while ignoring digits.
In the whole report condition, both digits and letters will need to be reported. 

Reports will be asked to the participants immediately after each display: they will be typed by the participation without considering their order. 
Then, the program will compare the participants' answers with the stimuli presented and compute the accuracy rate of responses in the different conditions.
